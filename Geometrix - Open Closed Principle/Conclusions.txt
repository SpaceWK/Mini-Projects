Class modified for Geometrix.WithOcp:
- created a new class for the triangle that implements the Shape Interface and returns the area of the triangle.
- in the program class: created an instance for the triangle shape with the specified dimensions.

Class modified for Geometrix.NoOcp:
- created a new class for the triangle where the dimensions are defined.
- in the geometricShape: Make a new case for the triangle and return the area.
- in the program class: created an instance for the triangle shape with the specified dimensions.

In conclusion the second project that not use the Open-Close Principle requires more modificationes then the first project.


Advantages:
- the OCP allows me to add new features without affecting the existing functionality.
- the OCP maked it easier to reuse the existing code by extending it instead of modifying it.
- you don't have the code in a single class and it makes it more visible

Disadvantages:
- the structure is more complex, there are many classes 
- can take longer to implement the OCP logic at the beginnning of the project
