# Geometrix

## Overview

There are two solutions in this repository:

- **Geometrix.NoOcp** - It does not respect the Open Closed Principle
- **Geometrix.WithOcp** - It does respect the Open Closed Principle

Both applications contain a class called `GeometricShapes` that handles a collection of... well... geometric shapes. It also offers a method to calculate the total area of the shapes it contains.

Currently there are only two types of shapes:

- rectangles
- circles

## Requirements

### 1) Add a triangle

For each of the two solutions do the followings:

- Update the application to also handle triangles for which the three sides are known.
  - Note: Heron's formula can help in calculating the area of the triangle.
- Make a list of the classes that you changed.

### 2) Advantages/Disadvantages

Think about the advantages and disadvantages of Open-Closed Principle based on the experience from resolving the exercise.

Write them in a document.
